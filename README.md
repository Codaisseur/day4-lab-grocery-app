# ðŸ›’DIY Grocery AppðŸ›’

I will give you a couple of `userstories` to implement using vanilla javascript (as in, jQuery or other libraries)


## This DIY should test your knowledge of:


- Searching the page
- Manipulating the DOM
- Listening for events


**Have a look at the todoapp you just built for inspiration.**

## Userstories:  

Userstories are a common way to describe requirements for software projects. They make you think from the perspective of a user.

As a < user >, I want to < do something >, so I can < feel, experience, solve my problem >

## Grocery list APP!

> Userstories:

> 1.) As a consumer, I want to see a list of grocery items, so I don't forget what to buy

> 2.) As a consumer, I want to cross items of my list, so I can keep track of what items I have already bought

> 3.) As a consumer, I want to be able to add items to my list, so I can keep my list relevant

> 4.) As a consumer, I want the app to count how many items are on my list, so I know how many shopping bags to bring

> 5.) As a consumer, I want to be able to add a quantity to each grocery item, so I only have to put each kind of item on my list once.

> BONUS!
> 6.) As a consumer, I want to be able to edit an item on my list, so I can make a mistake
